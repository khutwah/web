# Holidays

The holiday data serves as an identifier for various use cases within the application. One key use case is determining whether to generate draft Sabaq Activities for students.

## Types of Holidays

1. **Public Holiday**  
   Represents public holidays in Indonesia for the current year.

2. **General Holiday**  
   Covers holidays outside of public holidays, such as school trips or special events where students are not expected to perform Sabaq Activities.

3. **Student Holiday**  
   Represents holidays planned by specific students for particular reasons.

## Managing Holiday Data

Until a feature to manage holidays is implemented, admins can manually update the holiday data located at `@/data/holidays`.

Refer to the [@/data/holidays/README.md](../src/data/holidays/README.md) file for detailed instructions on how to manage the holiday data.
